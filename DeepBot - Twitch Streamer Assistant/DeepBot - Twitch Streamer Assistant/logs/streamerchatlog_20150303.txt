[03 Mar 18:07:09] <repentgamingtv> @mrpervsan http://deepbot.deep.sg/donate/ VIP is $5 a month, Include your streamer name in the Twitch ID box for automatic VIP. Once you donate, restart the bot for VIP to kick in

[03 Mar 18:07:34] <repentgamingtv> @dexskittles, you may not see it in chat, but it should be said.
[03 Mar 18:08:14] <repentgamingtv> @nikki_bruises You can change that here: http://deepbot.tv/dev/donationaccess/#Home

[03 Mar 18:25:18] <xirmak> whatcha got
[03 Mar 18:26:08] <fhgrundig2005> deepbot is only usuable in the twitch handle that you signed up with correct
[03 Mar 18:26:52] <xirmak> i believe that is correct
[03 Mar 18:27:37] <fhgrundig2005> ok i will be streaming from a friends twitch as a guest for a week or so and wanted to bring deepbot with me 
[03 Mar 18:31:04] <repentgamingtv> Ya, it's account bound.
[03 Mar 18:32:02] <fhgrundig2005> okie dokie
[03 Mar 18:35:52] <lynxzyyy> is there a way to have deepbot do his thang in your channel without having the program open or your comp on? i know its probbaly a dumb question, but i value my electricity :P
[03 Mar 18:36:18] <repentgamingtv> At the moment, no. But I believe with the new dashboard, you will be able to.
[03 Mar 18:36:54] <lynxzyyy> oh awesome, i suppose we will many more cool things in the future so patience is the key, loving it so far, only had deep for a week now.
[03 Mar 18:42:48] <officialfon> @repentgamingtv That sample custom donation page, very nice.  Is the plan for preformatted or for user CSS?
[03 Mar 18:43:22] <repentgamingtv> You will be able to customize, I know you will be able to do the background and sounds like you can do animations as well.
[03 Mar 18:44:01] <officialfon> very nice thank ya
[03 Mar 18:50:30] <nikki_bruises> Thanks again guys <3 much love! goodnight!
[03 Mar 19:01:16] <technicallycat> guys
[03 Mar 19:04:20] <technicallycat> is it possible to make a command that does !slap *input* ?
[03 Mar 19:04:23] <technicallycat> I tried @input@
[03 Mar 19:05:20] <repentgamingtv> Ya? Like  !slap repentgamingtv Message: Bot has slapped repentgamingtv?
[03 Mar 19:05:45] <technicallycat> yeah
[03 Mar 19:06:16] <repentgamingtv> Then it is @target@
[03 Mar 19:06:26] <technicallycat> oh thanks =)
[03 Mar 19:06:27] <repentgamingtv> http://deepbot.deep.sg/wiki/Custom+Commands&structure=Index&page_ref_id=16
[03 Mar 20:36:05] <thoma5tv> anyone availible
[03 Mar 20:36:50] <thoma5tv> multiple people are not reciving the pucks they win from bankheist or just being in the chat? any suggestions
[03 Mar 20:39:52] <repentgamingtv> Do you have the bankheist win output to something higher then 1.00?
[03 Mar 20:40:06] <repentgamingtv> They payout multiplier
[03 Mar 20:40:11] <goblin_warboss> Hey
[03 Mar 20:40:25] <goblin_warboss> what is the command to show all avalible commands in your twitch chat?
[03 Mar 20:40:38] <goblin_warboss> is it something like !commands?
[03 Mar 20:40:40] <repentgamingtv> !cmdlist
[03 Mar 20:40:47] <goblin_warboss> Thaks buddy
[03 Mar 20:41:16] <repentgamingtv> Of course you can change it with custom commands
[03 Mar 20:41:54] <thoma5tv> payment multipler is level 1.57
[03 Mar 20:42:40] <repentgamingtv> So they get whatever they put in, and only 57% of that amount.
[03 Mar 20:44:59] <thoma5tv> what numbers do you suggest because that sucks lol
[03 Mar 20:46:19] <thoma5tv> nevermind I read that wrong thanks for the help brother

[03 Mar 21:02:17] <repentgamingtv> you could *
[03 Mar 21:04:30] <thoma5tv> yeah
[03 Mar 21:04:44] <thoma5tv> ill be in my chat waiting for you 
[03 Mar 21:08:12] <greybush87> to keep VIP we have to donate each month?
[03 Mar 21:08:39] <thoma5tv> ^^^ yes or you can set a date in the edit user tab
[03 Mar 21:08:58] <thoma5tv> in the user database tab
[03 Mar 21:09:42] <thoma5tv> or you can go to the donation notification settings and set the ammount of time you want them to hav evip
[03 Mar 21:09:42] <greybush87> no i mean for the bots follower and donation tracking like my vip status with the bot for my account
[03 Mar 21:10:13] <thoma5tv> oh yes you have to donate to deepbot everymonth to keep that vip
[03 Mar 21:10:20] <thoma5tv> its worth it
[03 Mar 21:10:26] <thoma5tv> this bot is amaing
[03 Mar 21:10:28] <greybush87> if i donate again with they automatically see it and update it?.
[03 Mar 21:10:33] <thoma5tv> and will only get better
[03 Mar 21:10:52] <thoma5tv> it shoud be updated fast 
[03 Mar 21:11:58] <greybush87> so i dont have to post anywhere that i donated and ask for my VIP to be reinstated
[03 Mar 21:12:47] <repentgamingtv> You donate $5 here: http://deepbot.deep.sg/donate/ Put your stream name in the twitch ID box, after you donate, restart deepbot.
[03 Mar 21:13:24] <greybush87> thanks!
[03 Mar 21:13:35] <repentgamingtv> Np
[03 Mar 21:18:05] <thoma5tv> is there a way to keep people from getting points by staying in chat all night long I have one guy that leaves his comp in my chat all night and just collects it not fair to others
[03 Mar 21:18:37] <repentgamingtv> Yes.
[03 Mar 21:18:58] <repentgamingtv> Config>Gear (Upper Right Corner)>Point options
[03 Mar 21:21:51] <thoma5tv> is it the only issue points to people active in chat for x ammout of time?
[03 Mar 21:22:10] <thoma5tv> if so what do you suggest I set it to 
[03 Mar 21:22:14] <repentgamingtv> Yes. So if they say something in chat within x mins they will get points
[03 Mar 21:22:39] <repentgamingtv> What is your offline time/online time point set to?
[03 Mar 21:23:12] <thoma5tv> online is 5 for every 15 offline is 1 every 25
[03 Mar 21:25:54] <thoma5tv> what would you suggest? maybe 4-5 min
[03 Mar 21:28:14] <repentgamingtv> Well its within the last x mins so if you set it to 30, only people who typed in 30 mins would get points 2 times for your online timer
[03 Mar 21:28:43] <repentgamingtv> So I think 30 would work.
[03 Mar 21:29:33] <thoma5tv> ok thanks so much for your help man this bot is amazing!!!
[03 Mar 21:33:06] <e_n_t> is there a list of all the rank for deepbot?
