[25 Mar 17:15:20] <omegafeargaming> hmmm damn no help today
[25 Mar 17:31:25] <thelonegamer24> Hi
[25 Mar 18:14:50] <typeforced> "FNDBot: Get back here you Lazy Sod"
[25 Mar 18:14:56] <typeforced> Why did my bot just type this into my twitch chat
[25 Mar 18:15:03] <typeforced> without any commands for it being requested
[25 Mar 18:23:33] <typeforced> Anyone here?
[25 Mar 18:28:37] <cameronavfc72> hi
[25 Mar 18:28:54] <kenny_plays> hello
[25 Mar 18:29:21] <typeforced> did anyones bot just speak out?
[25 Mar 18:29:46] <cameronavfc72> no
[25 Mar 18:30:40] <typeforced> does the boy say "lazy sod" for any reason?
[25 Mar 18:30:44] <typeforced> can someone trigger that?
[25 Mar 18:55:24] <dexskittles> hi
[25 Mar 19:11:21] <dexskittles> so my vip access ran out. if someone wants to donate, and they donate 5$ will the bot link still work then reactivate the vip status?
