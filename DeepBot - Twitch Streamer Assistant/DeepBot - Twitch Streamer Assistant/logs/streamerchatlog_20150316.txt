[16 Mar 20:33:46] <repentgamingtv> @chemicalgaming_ currently no.
[16 Mar 20:34:21] <repentgamingtv> Unless you play the music thru the a web browser. With the deepbot url, you probably could
[16 Mar 20:35:47] <xxgxhxoxsxtxx> Repent i am going to Post this Picture in the help Support section 
[16 Mar 20:36:04] <repentgamingtv> Okay ghost
[16 Mar 20:36:38] <repentgamingtv> For Music, you can load this in your browser : http://deepbot.deep.sg/YouTubePlayerv4.html?ip=[DeepBot Computer IP Here] (Use IPv4 for local hosting computer. Or the computer's external IP for across the internet.)
[16 Mar 20:36:38] <xxgxhxoxsxtxx> this will give you a better idea of what i see all the time when i attempt to preview and gain a follower 
[16 Mar 20:37:24] <repentgamingtv> Take a pic of your follower settings too then. I have a feeling it is a setting.
