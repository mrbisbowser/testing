[01 Mar 06:56:19] <verystyler> Yeah what's up?
[01 Mar 06:59:54] <fsudarkgamer> hello
[01 Mar 07:00:40] <fsudarkgamer> is there any way to reduce the amount of hours needed to rank up in the point system?
[01 Mar 07:13:24] <ciand17> I don't think so
[01 Mar 07:57:11] <itauntmidgets> anyone good with macros?
[01 Mar 07:57:25] <arctomian> itauntmidgets i like you to come on teamspeak please
[01 Mar 07:57:38] <itauntmidgets> uh oh
[01 Mar 09:03:12] <superdotaplaya> so the owner of the bot said he acivaed vip for me, but i still canno do anything that a VIP can do.
[01 Mar 09:08:52] <expertsonline>  superdotaplaya please reinstall the bot. I can see the VIP is activated on the server.
[01 Mar 09:18:26] <itauntmidgets> a command of mine isnt working
[01 Mar 09:18:30] <itauntmidgets> its !vote
[01 Mar 09:20:04] <expertsonline>  vote is an internal command - you cant use that
[01 Mar 09:34:53] <officialfon> Hah!  Streamer Chat this is a brilliant feature.  Live community/dev support IN the app.  Spectacular.
[01 Mar 09:35:32] <officialfon> I didn't realize I was on the wrong chat tab, went over to my Twitch room to see why you guys all hijacked my channel to discuss bot features :)
[01 Mar 09:37:07] <expertsonline>  :)
[01 Mar 09:39:36] <officialfon> As streamers and viewers, does anyone here encourage viewers to watch stream from their personal website rather than Twitch.tv?  Anyone have a functional twitch interface running embedded in a personal website?
[01 Mar 09:44:36] <verystyler> @officialfon Yeah worked on something like that
[01 Mar 09:45:19] <officialfon> Ah cool I just wanted to see some examples, is it still online?
[01 Mar 09:48:18] <verystyler> No sorry not online atm
[01 Mar 09:48:41] <verystyler> The point is just to bring more than the actual twitch page.
[01 Mar 09:49:16] <officialfon> Yeah I was curious to see some design implementations, and to see if the embed has as many javascript errors as I'm getting lol
[01 Mar 09:52:26] <officialfon> Right now I'm looking for royalty free sound effects that are all fantasy themed (monster sounds, swords clashing, magic spells) and just found 8 pages of roughly 80 audio clips of the same crappy "spell" effect.
[01 Mar 09:57:25] <officialfon> Ugh, if I give up on being able to interact with the chat from my website I can make the interface so much more attractive; I just hate to conceed that point to Twitch.tv! :)
[01 Mar 09:57:34] <feelmaster> Go to youtube.
[01 Mar 09:57:53] <officialfon> What's on youtube Feelmaster?
[01 Mar 09:58:06] <officialfon> ohh for sound effects?
[01 Mar 09:58:07] <feelmaster> SFX and royalty free music
[01 Mar 09:58:21] <officialfon> ah yes what a great idea hah, hadn't even dawned on me
[01 Mar 10:02:32] <feelmaster> In creator studio, there is many free songs and sfx in youtube.
[01 Mar 10:03:04] <expertsonline>  saw this template on reddit once - not bad for a basic profile page. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abUHio_66Wo
[01 Mar 10:05:25] <officialfon> Oooo thanks Experts I'm gonna watch this now!
[01 Mar 10:20:13] <ghazzy> The "!songrequest" command only works when im actually live? Trying to test it before going live but nothing happenbs
[01 Mar 10:20:51] <officialfon> Ah my first live broadcast is April 1st so I haven't even begun testing all the extra goodies
[01 Mar 10:21:04] <expertsonline>  its !requestsong
[01 Mar 10:21:24] <officialfon> Hehe feature request, iTunes playlist integration lol.  I am NOT looking forward to remaking my lists in YouTube but such is the industry :)
[01 Mar 10:22:37] <officialfon> that was a joke btw, I don't want users controlling my itunes :)
[01 Mar 10:23:03] <ghazzy> ah
[01 Mar 10:23:06] <ghazzy> thanks guys
[01 Mar 10:29:09] <reptile_eu> hi guys music player doesnt work
[01 Mar 10:29:21] <reptile_eu> got any ideas?
[01 Mar 10:36:31] <ham_carlwinslow> What does it say?  If it's saying something about HTML 5 there's a forum post about it 
[01 Mar 10:36:38] <ham_carlwinslow> Let me see if I can find the link 
[01 Mar 10:37:08] <ham_carlwinslow> http://deepbot.deep.sg/forums/index.php?topic=622.0
[01 Mar 10:37:17] <ham_carlwinslow> there's the forum post check the last post on it 
[01 Mar 11:03:10] <doktorpeng> is there a command that shows the commandlist sorted by acces level?
[01 Mar 11:07:09] <siqual_tv> reptile_eu by me is the music player fine 
[01 Mar 12:31:50] <thoma5tv> Hey quick question. my music isnt working if the viewer puts in a url it dose nothing
[01 Mar 12:32:24] <thoma5tv> when I add url same thing
[01 Mar 12:35:14] <craciez> is he using !requestsong?
[01 Mar 12:36:38] <thoma5tv> yes !requestsong then url
[01 Mar 12:37:01] <thoma5tv> and the music player does nothing
[01 Mar 12:37:29] <thoma5tv> no error no nothing just shows the same black screen with the stars or whatever is default
[01 Mar 13:44:11] <jammer_550> i got that when chrome was my default browser had to switch back to IE being default and it cleared it up
[01 Mar 13:45:05] <gam3k3y> question?
[01 Mar 13:45:25] <gam3k3y> I have multihost on but some channels are getting skipped as is they are offline
[01 Mar 13:45:30] <gam3k3y> what do i do?
[01 Mar 13:46:22] <repentgamingtv> Do you have randomized on?
[01 Mar 13:46:40] <gam3k3y> yea
[01 Mar 13:46:54] <repentgamingtv> Then it will do a random stream, instead of going down the list.
[01 Mar 13:46:58] <gam3k3y> oh that random time not random list order?
[01 Mar 13:48:12] <repentgamingtv> I mean as in in will randomly select someone from your list of streams.
[01 Mar 13:49:21] <gam3k3y> ok the problem im having is some of the live streams last for 1 or 2 mins then areskipped and another stream may get the full 30mins
[01 Mar 13:55:00] <repentgamingtv> Maybe set the offline time to 5 mins? 
[01 Mar 13:57:31] <gam3k3y> ok
[01 Mar 14:06:03] <maskedvilliangaming> @repentgamingtv quick question. if i download another deepbot client for my gf on a second hard drive and close mine she should be able to use it on my pc correct?
[01 Mar 14:32:26] <gam3k3y> @repentgamingtv i'm still having the issue where its hosting and deciding people are offline idk whats making the bot register hosts as offline when they are streaming
[01 Mar 18:28:43] <ecoay> i am writing a review on deep bot (thus the reason asking about referral) Is it possible to get a big picture of the deep bot bot
[01 Mar 18:29:42] <repentgamingtv> o.o Like a banner or someting?
[01 Mar 18:29:52] <ecoay> no like the bot image
[01 Mar 18:30:12] <ecoay> I can only find it like 350px high largest ive found
[01 Mar 18:31:12] <ecoay> too fit the main image size for a review needs to be about 900x900px or it stretches it and looks god awful. found the one from contact page that is over 1k wide but not tall enough
[01 Mar 18:31:26] <repentgamingtv> Could try this one: http://puu.sh/eDyDx.jpg
[01 Mar 18:33:00] <ecoay> this one would be nice if it wernt cropped http://deepbot.deep.sg/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/cropped-bot_ban.jpg
[01 Mar 18:33:10] <ecoay> basically just looking for the full face
[01 Mar 18:34:03] <ecoay> like the loading sequence image would be perfect is it stored locally?

[01 Mar 19:06:24] <officialfon> @ecoay http://www.desktopaper.com/wp-content/uploads/awesome-robot-android-head-wire-formula.jpg
[01 Mar 19:06:40] <repentgamingtv> Ya what bighead said
[01 Mar 19:07:37] <bigheadgamers> $5 is nothing really
[01 Mar 19:07:45] <bigheadgamers> for what you get
[01 Mar 19:08:05] <bigheadgamers> this loyalty bot has helpped me keep viewers
[01 Mar 19:08:39] <bigheadgamers> gained so many followers $5 is well worth it
[01 Mar 19:09:11] <bigheadgamers> is there away to add deepbot link to my twitch panel
[01 Mar 19:09:46] <bigheadgamers> so more streamers can come check it out
[01 Mar 19:11:30] <angelofgrace_> I agree 5$ is pretty much nothing for all the goodies :) just wanted to make sure how much it was
[01 Mar 19:11:34] <angelofgrace_> so this is per month?
[01 Mar 19:11:35] <repentgamingtv> The one I use: http://static-cdn.jtvnw.net/jtv_user_pictures/panel-45104184-image-56397587cf3597cb-320.jpeg
