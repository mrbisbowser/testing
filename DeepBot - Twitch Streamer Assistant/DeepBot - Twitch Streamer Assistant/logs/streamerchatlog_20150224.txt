[24 Feb 18:37:18] <ecoay> Is there a way to have a deepbot instance in multiple channels to record points for an entire stream team?
[24 Feb 18:37:56] <repentgamingtv> No. 
[24 Feb 18:38:13] <ecoay> ahhh :(
[24 Feb 18:40:07] <repentgamingtv> I believe someone else was wondering that as well. Not sure if it was feature request tho.
[24 Feb 19:59:05] <dodge_ballin> this thing eats up a TON of real estate on my alt monitor. Is there any way to make it a little more compact?
[24 Feb 20:03:29] <repentgamingtv> You mean resize the window? Not really.
[24 Feb 20:03:50] <dodge_ballin> yeah...thats unforutnate
[24 Feb 20:04:43] <dodge_ballin> cuz i dont really like the notification system of deepbot(not enough customization options) so im trying to run it, twitchalerts, obs, and my TS3 all kinda on one screen(19")...
[24 Feb 20:04:45] <repentgamingtv> I mean you sort of can, but it messes up a little bit.
[24 Feb 20:04:50] <dodge_ballin> eh
[24 Feb 20:04:58] <dodge_ballin> it messes up enough without my encouragement
[24 Feb 20:05:11] <repentgamingtv> Ya. The donation system is being redone and all that.
[24 Feb 20:05:42] <dodge_ballin> yesterday it flat lagged out when i tried to roll a giveaway and i ended up rolling twice cuz i saw nothing but my stream saw the roll.
[24 Feb 20:06:04] <dodge_ballin> luckily everyone knew i was having issues or it woulda looked really shady
[24 Feb 20:07:18] <repentgamingtv> Ya. Notice some issues recently with things. But ya
[24 Feb 20:07:38] <dodge_ballin> ok well thanks for the info
[24 Feb 20:07:45] <dodge_ballin> gotta get this shit started...already late XD
[24 Feb 20:11:20] <mercury3rd> when the new alerts are finally here, can we still have different layouts for the scenes. Or will it be one layout for the whole alert?
[24 Feb 20:15:55] <pr1metimetvx> Is there a way to enable emoticons in deep chat?
[24 Feb 20:17:58] <repentgamingtv> No? :o
[24 Feb 20:18:13] <pr1metimetvx> =/
[24 Feb 20:18:41] <pr1metimetvx> like when people do a twich emoticon on deep chat you can only see the text of it
[24 Feb 20:21:28] <repentgamingtv> Ya
